# Gradient-Boosted-Tree
Boosted tree with XG boost


This is a program designed to forecast future company sales. It is designed to aid in labor needs and company outlook.

It uses data from an internal database, an api, and feature extraction.

Once the data is formatted, it is fed into a gradient boosted tree model to train on the most current data.

Charts and metrics can be output once training is complete, and predictions can be made on specific days. 

This program is also integrated into a tkinter gui.
